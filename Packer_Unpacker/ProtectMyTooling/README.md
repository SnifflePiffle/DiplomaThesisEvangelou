# Don't Detect Tools - Detect Techniques

Rationale behind releasing this software was outlined in an acompanying blog post:

- [ProtectMyTooling - Don't detect tools, detect techniques](https://mgeeky.tech/protectmytooling/)

## Intro

Script that wraps around multitude of packers, protectors, obfuscators, shellcode loaders, encoders, generators to produce complex protected Red Team implants.
Your perfect companion in Malware Development CI/CD pipeline, **helping watermark your artifacts, collect IOCs, backdoor and more**.

**ProtectMyToolingGUI.py**

![3.png](images/3.png)


With `ProtectMyTooling` you can quickly obfuscate your binaries without having to worry about clicking through all the Dialogs, interfaces, menus, creating projects to obfuscate a single binary, clicking through all the options available and wasting time about all that nonsense. It takes you straight to the point - to obfuscate your tool.

Aim is to offer the most convenient interface possible and allow to leverage _a daisy-chain of multiple packers_ combined on a single binary.

That's right - we can launch `ProtectMyTooling` with several packers at once:

```
C:\> py ProtectMyTooling.py hyperion,upx mimikatz.exe mimikatz-obf.exe
```

The above example will firstly pass `mimikatz.exe` to the Hyperion for obfuscation, and then the result will be provided to UPX for compression. Resulting with `UPX(Hyperion(file))`


## Features

- Supports multiple different PE Packers, .NET Obfuscators, Shellcode Loaders/Builders
- Allows daisy-chaining packers where output from a packer is passed to the consecutive one: `callobf,hyperion,upx` will produce artifact `UPX(Hyperion(CallObf(file)))`
- Collects IOCs at every obfuscation step so that auditing & Blue Team requests can be satisfied
- Offers functionality to inject custom Watermarks to resulting PE artifacts - in DOS Stub, Checksum, as a standalone PE Section, to file's Overlay
- Comes up with a handy Cobalt Strike aggressor script bringing `protected-upload` and `protected-execute-assembly` commands
- Straightforward command line usage


## Installation

**This tool was designed to work on Windows, as most packers natively target that platform.**

Some features may work however on Linux just fine, nonetheless that support is not fully tested, please report bugs and issues.

1. First, **disable your AV** and add `contrib` directory to exclusions. That directory contains obfuscators, protectors which will get flagged by AV and removed.
2. Then clone this repository
```
PS C:\> git clone --recurse https://github.com/Binary-Offensive/ProtectMyTooling
```

3. Actual installation is straightforward:

  **Windows**
```
PS C:\ProtectMyTooling> .\install.ps1
```

  **Linux**
```
bash# ./install.sh
```

### Gimmicks

For `ScareCrow` packer to run on Windows 10, there needs to be `WSL` installed and `bash.exe` available (in `%PATH%`).
Then, in WSL one needs to have `golang` installed in version at least `1.16`:

```
cmd> bash
bash$ sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade -y ; sudo apt install golang=2:1.18~3 -y
```

## Configuration

To plug-in supported obfuscators, change default options or point **ProtectMyTooling** to your obfuscator executable path, you will need to adjust `config\ProtectMyTooling.yaml` configuration file.

There is also `config\sample-full-config.yaml` file containing all the available options for all the supported packers, serving as reference point.


## Friendly reminder

- If your produced binary crashes or doesn't run as expected - try using different packers chain.
- Packers don't guarantee stability of produced binaries, therefore ProtectMyTooling cannot as well.
- While chaining, carefully match output->input payload formats according to what consecutive packer expects.

---

## Usage

Before `ProtectMyTooling`'s first use, it is essential to adjust program's YAML configuration file `ProtectMyTooling.yaml`. 
The order of parameters processal is following:

- Firstly default parameters are used
- Then they're overwritten by values coming from YAML
- Finally, whatever is provided in command line will overwrite corresponding values

There, supported packer paths and options shall be set to enable.

### Scenario 1: Simple ConfuserEx obfuscation

Usage is very simple, all it takes is to pass the name of obfuscator to choose, input and output file paths:

```
C:\> py ProtectMyTooling.py confuserex Rubeus.exe Rubeus-obf.exe

    ::::::::::.:::::::..      ...  :::::::::::.,::::::  .,-::::::::::::::::

### Scenario 2: Simple ConfuserEx obfuscation followed by artifact test

One can also obfuscate the file and immediately attempt to launch it (also with supplied optional parameters) to ensure it runs fine with options `-r --cmdline CMDLINE`:

```
C:\> py ProtectMyTooling.py confuserex Rubeus.exe Rubeus-obf.exe -r --cmdline "hash /password:foobar"

```

### Scenario 3: Complex malware obfuscation with watermarking and IOCs collection

Below use case takes `beacon.exe` on input and feeds it consecutively into `CallObf` -> `UPX` -> `Hyperion` packers.

Then it will inject specified `fooobar` watermark to the final generated output artifact's DOS Stub as well as modify that artifact's checksum with value `0xAABBCCDD`.

Finally, ProtectMyTooling will capture all IOCs (md5, sha1, sha256, imphash, and other metadata) and save them in auxiliary CSV file. That file can be used for IOC matching as engagement unfolds.

```
PS> py .\ProtectMyTooling.py callobf,upx,hyperion beacon.exe beacon-obf.exe -i -I operation_chimera -w dos-stub=fooobar -w checksum=0xaabbccdd

Above are the packers that are supported, but that doesn't mean that you have them configured and ready to use. 
To prepare their usage, you must first supply necessary binaries to the `contrib` directory and then configure your YAML file accordingly.

# RedWatermarker - built-in Artifact watermarking

## Artifact watermarking & IOC collection

This program is intended for professional Red Teams and is perfect to be used in a typical implant-development CI/CD pipeline. 
As a red teamer I'm always expected to deliver decent quality list of IOCs matching back to all of my implants as well as I find it essential to watermark all my implants for bookkeeping, attribution and traceability purposes.

To accommodate these requirements, ProtectMyTooling brings basic support for them.

### Artifact Watermarking

`ProtectMyTooling` can apply watermarks after obfuscation rounds simply by using `--watermark` option.:

```
py ProtectMyTooling [...] -w dos-stub=fooooobar -w checksum=0xaabbccdd -w section=.coco,ALLYOURBASEAREBELONG
```

There is also a standalone approach, included in `RedWatermarker.py` script.

It takes executable artifact on input and accepts few parameters denoting where to inject a watermark and what value shall be inserted. 

Example run will set PE Checksum to 0xAABBCCDD, inserts `foooobar` to PE file's DOS Stub (bytes containing _This program cannot be run..._), appends `bazbazbaz` to file's overlay and then create a new PE section named `.coco` append it to the end of file and fill that section with preset marker.

```
py RedWatermarker.py beacon-obf.exe -c 0xaabbccdd -t fooooobar -e bazbazbaz -s .coco,ALLYOURBASEAREBELONG
```

Full watermarker usage:

```

    Watermark thy implants, track them in VirusTotal
    Mariusz Banach / mgeeky '22, (@mariuszbit)
    <mb@binary-offensive.com>

usage: RedWatermarker.py [options] <infile>

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Required arguments:
  infile                Input implant file

Optional arguments:
  -C, --check           Do not actually inject watermark. Check input file if it contains specified watermarks.
  -v, --verbose         Verbose mode.
  -d, --debug           Debug mode.
  -o PATH, --outfile PATH
                        Path where to save output file with watermark injected. If not given, will modify infile.

PE Executables Watermarking:
  -t STR, --dos-stub STR
                        Insert watermark into PE DOS Stub (This program cannot be run...).
  -c NUM, --checksum NUM
                        Preset PE checksum with this value (4 bytes). Must be number. Can start with 0x for hex value.
  -e STR, --overlay STR
                        Append watermark to the file's Overlay (at the end of the file).
  -s NAME,STR, --section NAME,STR
                        Append a new PE section named NAME and insert watermark there. Section name must be shorter than 8 characters. Section will be marked Read-Only, non-executable.
```

Currently only PE files watermarking is supported, but in the future Office documents and other formats are to be added as well.


### IOCs Collection

IOCs may be collected by simply using `-i` option in `ProtectMyTooling` run.

They're being collected at the following phases:

- on the input file
- after each obfuscation round on an intermediary file
- on the final output file

They will contain following fields saved in form of a CSV file:

- `timestamp`
- `filename`
- `author` - formed as `username@hostname`
- `context` - whether a record points to an input, output or intermediary file
- `comment` - value adjusted by the user through `-I value` option
- `md5`
- `sha1`
- `sha256`
- `imphash` - PE Imports Hash, if available
- (TODO) `typeref_hash` - .NET TypeRef Hash, if available

Resulting will be a CSV file named `outfile-ioc.csv` stored side by side to generated output artifact. That file is written in APPEND mode, meaning it will receive all subsequent IOCs.


# RedBackdoorer - built-in PE Backdooring

`ProtectMyTooling` utilizes my own `RedBackdoorer.py` script which provides few methods for backdooring PE executables. 
Support comes as a dedicated packer named `backdoor`. Example usage:

**Takes Cobalt Strike shellcode on input and encodes with SGN (Shikata Ga-Nai) then backdoors SysInternals DbgView64.exe then produces Amber EXE reflective loader**

First one denotes where to store shellcode, second how to run it:

<mode>

    save,run
      |   |
      |   +---------- 1 - change AddressOfEntryPoint
      |               2 - hijack branching instruction at Original Entry Point (jmp, call, ...)
      |               3 - setup TLS callback
      |
      +-------------- 1 - store shellcode in the middle of a code section
                      2 - append shellcode to the PE file in a new PE section
Example:

    py RedBackdoorer.py 1,2 beacon.bin putty.exe putty-infected.exe
```

# Cobalt Strike Integration

There is also a script that integrates `ProtectMyTooling.py` used as a wrapper around configured PE/.NET Packers/Protectors in order to easily transform input executables into their protected and compressed output forms and then upload or use them from within CobaltStrike.

The idea is to have an automated process of protecting all of the uploaded binaries or .NET assemblies used by execute-assembly and forget about protecting or obfuscating them manually before each usage. The added benefit of an automated approach to transform executables is the ability to have the same executable protected each time it's used, resulting in unique samples launched on target machines. That should nicely deceive EDR/AV enterprise-wide IOC sweeps while looking for the same artefact on different machines.

Additionally, the protected-execute-assembly command has the ability to look for assemblies of which
only name were given in a preconfigured assemblies directory (set in dotnet_assemblies_directory setting).

To use it:

1. Load `CobaltStrike/ProtectMyTooling.cna` in your Cobalt Strike.
2. Go to the menu and setup all the options

![options](images/options.png)

3. Then in your Beacon's console you'll have following commands available:

  * `protected-execute-assembly` - Executes a local, previously protected and compressed .NET program in-memory on target.
  * `protected-upload` - Takes an input file, protects it if its PE executable and then uploads that file to specified remote location.
  * `bofnet_load_protected` - Takes input .NET assembly file, passes it through configured .NET packers chain, loads generated output with `bofnet_load`. [BOFNET](https://github.com/CCob/BOF.NET/) needs to be loaded separetely for this to work.

Basically these commands will open input files, pass the firstly to the `CobaltStrike/cobaltProtectMyTooling.py` script, which in turn calls out to `ProtectMyTooling.py`. As soon as the binary gets obfuscated, it will be passed to your beacon for execution/uploading. 

## Cobalt Strike related Options

Here's a list of options required by the Cobalt Strike integrator:

* `python3_interpreter_path` - Specify a path to Python3 interpreter executable
* `protect_my_tooling_dir` - Specify a path to ProtectMyTooling main directory
* `protect_my_tooling_config` - Specify a path to ProtectMyTooling configuration file with various packers options
* `dotnet_assemblies_directory` - Specify local path .NET assemblies should be looked for if not found by execute-assembly
* `cache_protected_executables` - Enable to cache already protected executables and reuse them when needed
* `protected_executables_cache_dir` - Specify a path to a directory that should store cached protected executables
* `default_exe_x86_packers_chain` - Native x86 EXE executables protectors/packers chain
* `default_exe_x64_packers_chain` - Native x64 EXE executables protectors/packers chain
* `default_dll_x86_packers_chain` - Native x86 DLL executables protectors/packers chain
* `default_dll_x64_packers_chain` - Native x64 DLL executables protectors/packers chain
* `default_dotnet_packers_chain` - .NET executables protectors/packers chain

## Known Issues

- `ScareCrow` is very tricky to run from Windows. What worked for me is following:
  1. Run on Windows 10 and have WSL installed (`bash.exe` command available in Windows)
  2. Have `golang` installed in WSL at version `1.16+` (tested on `1.18`)
  3. Make sure to have `PackerScareCrow.Run_ScareCrow_On_Windows_As_WSL = True` set

---

## Credits due & used technology

- All packer, obfuscator, converter, loader credits goes to their authors. This tool is merely a wrapper around their technology!
  - Hopefully none of them mind me adding such wrappers. Should there be concerns - please reach out to me.
  
- _ProtectMyTooling_ also uses [`denim.exe`](https://github.com/moloch--/denim) by **moloch--** by some Nim-based packers.


---

## TODO

- Write custom PE injector and offer it as a "protector"
- Add watermarking to other file formats such as Office documents, WSH scripts (VBS, JS, HTA) and containers
